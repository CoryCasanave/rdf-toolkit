# Dependencies

The rdf-serializer works with the following major libraries:

# [OWLAPI](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi)
# [Sesame](https://bitbucket.org/openrdf/sesame)

| Sources | https://bitbucket.org/openrdf/sesame or https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi |
| Docs | http://rdf4j.org/documentation.docbook?view |

The Sesame API is embedded in the code (currently as Java code) and can be invoked in two ways:

- Through its own Main Class from the command line
- Through the primary command line interface via the `--api sesame` switch.
