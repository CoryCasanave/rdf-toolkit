rdf-serializer
==============


Code for a command-line stable serializer for RDF.  This will be used in a commit-hook to make sure that all RDF files in the repo are stored in the same way. 


Requirements are being gathered at a [wiki page](https://github.com/EnterpriseDataManagementCouncil/rdf-serializer/wiki/Requirements)
